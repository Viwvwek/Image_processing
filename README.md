# Image Processing App

This project is a web-based **Image Processing Application** built with **React**. It allows users to apply various image processing techniques such as **Grayscale, Edge Detection, Thresholding, Sepia Effect, Saturation, and Contrast Enhancement**.

## Features
- **Grayscale** – Converts the image to shades of gray.
- **Edge Detection** – Highlights edges using edge-detection algorithms.
- **Thresholding** – Converts an image to binary format based on a threshold value.
- **Sepia Effect** – Applies a warm, brownish tint to create a vintage look.
- **Saturation Adjustment** – Enhances or reduces the intensity of colors.
- **Contrast Enhancement** – Adjusts contrast to make details more pronounced.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. \
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot revert back.

## How to Use
1. Upload an image.
2. Select one or multiple processing options (e.g., Grayscale, Edge Detection).
3. View the processed image in real-time.
4. Download the modified image if needed.
